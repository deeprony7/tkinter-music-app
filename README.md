# tkinter-music-app

A rough draft at a python music player using Tkinter. 
App works for the most part with few bugs. However, music play ability remains unhampered. 

App is designed with two main frames under the root. 
    > Left holds the playlist
    > Right holds the music control buttons along with volume slider

Hope to incorporate a seekbar in a future commit.
